\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}
This book is inspired by The Little Book of Deep Learning by prof. Francois Fleuret \cite{} and aims to develop a guide on python with the focus on machine learning and deep learning fundamental techniques with PyTorch or python in general. This book is currently a collective effort, open-source and welcomes contribution from authors and programmers.

\part{History}


%% This first part provides a minimal background about machine
%% learning, issues and techniques for efficient computation, and the
%% strategies to train a parametric model.

\chapter{Introduction}
Guido van Rossum born 31 January 1956 is a Dutch programmer and the creator of the Python programming language. Python programming language is comparatively underrated as it supports programming paradigms such as structured, object-oriented and functional. It has support from multiple organizations writing and maintaining the collectively large standard and user function libraries.
